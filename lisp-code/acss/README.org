* ACSS: AFL Implementation That Outputs ACSS

A new implementation of Audio Formatting Language (AFL) as used in
AsTeR. This implementation wil output strings annotated with ACSS
properties, and make that output available via a socket. When
complete, swapping out the old AFL implementation in AsTeR should give
us a version of AsTeR that module ~emacspeak-maths~ can use.
