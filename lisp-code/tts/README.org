This directory will implement a module to bridge between AsTeR and the
Emacspeak family of speech servers. When fully implemented, it will
replace module dectalk implemented in ../synthesizer.

Building a bridge from AsTeR to Emacspeak consists of two steps:

  1. Implement the equivalent of emacspeak/stumpwm/tts.lisp to connect to a listening Emacspeak TTS server.
  2. Implement AFL modules that map the various audio dimensions to synthesizer specific codes.

** TBD:

  1. Support Clisp, SBCL or both?
