This directory will implement a module to bridge between AsTeR and the
Emacspeak family of speech servers. When fully implemented, it will
replace module dectalk implemented in ../synthesizer.

Building a bridge from AsTeR to Emacspeak consists of two steps:

  1. Implement the equivalent of emacspeak/stumpwm/tts.lisp to connect to a listening Emacspeak TTS server.
  2. Implement AFL modules that map the various audio dimensions to synthesizer specific codes.

** Clisp Usage Instructions

  1. We use ASDF as the system definition facility ---  these
     instructions assume ASDF is installed.
  2. Start Clisp with the .clisprc provided in the base directory  ---
     this loads ASDF.
  3. Evaluate (asdf:load-system :tts) to load the TTS module.
  4. (tts:init) to initialize TTS.
  5. (tts:speak "This is a test.")
